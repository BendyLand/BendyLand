ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BendyLand or Ben

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in software systems programming, specifically surrounding internal tooling and/or language design.
 - I also think game development is pretty neat. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of programming and general computer science on my own. (I may not have a CS degree, but luckily I do have one in education.) 
 - I have a habit of trying out very simple programs in several languages before moving onto something harder. 
 - Right now, my favorite langauges to use are Rust, Swift, Scala, Go, C, C++, F#, Lua, Julia, and Python.
 - Besides those, I have tried (at least a little) C#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Kotlin, Groovy, Ruby, Gleam, Odin, Zig, and PHP.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, they/them, it/that, hey you... (I'm not very picky; call me whatever's easiest.)

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a twisty puzzles enthusiast. My "Sunday crossword" equivalent is: 
 - 2x2 > 3x3 > 4x4 > 5x5 Rubik's cubes, followed by 
 - Pyraminx > Skewb > Megaminx > Curvy Copter, and finally
 - Square-1 > Puppet Cube v2 > Ghost Cube > Tony Fisher's Golden Cube.
   - This list goes roughly in order of how much trouble the puzzle gives *me*, isolated by each row. 
   - The whole thing takes me around an hour to solve; sometimes a bit shorter if I get lucky, and sometimes a bit longer if I get weird jumbling cases.
   - Somehow, this is fun to me.

ðŸŽ“ Tech people that I'm inspired by: 
Donald Knuth, Linus Torvalds, Terry A. Davis, Chris Lattner, John Carmack, Tim Sweeney, Michael Reeves, Toby Fox, Thor (Pirate Software), ThePrimeagen, LowLevelLearning, DHH, Matz
