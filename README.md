ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben! (a.k.a. @BendyLand)

ðŸŒ± I enjoy systems programming, particularly involving internal tooling, language design, and other low-level development. I often write software that simplifies complex workflows and enhances developer productivity. I also think game development is pretty nifty.

ðŸ’¼ More professionally, I specialize in hard-to-solve bugs, cross-domain debugging, and making broken systems stable. 

> **If it crashes and nobody knows why, Iâ€™ll find out.**

âš¡ Quick info: 
 - I am most proficient in C, C++, Zig, Odin, Rust, Go, and Python.
 - Iâ€™ve also dabbled in functional languages (Haskell, F#, OCaml), JVM/JS ecosystems (Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, Clojure, JS/TS), and a smattering of others (C#, Swift, Ruby, Lua, Julia).
   - (I did say I like language design)
 - My favorite game engines are Unreal (for 3D) and Godot (for 2D).
