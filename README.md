ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben! (a.k.a. @BendyLand)

ðŸŒ± I enjoy systems programming, particularly involving internal tooling, language design, and other low-level development. I often write software that simplifies complex workflows and enhances developer productivity. I also think game development is pretty nifty.

ðŸ’¼ More professionally, I specialize in hard-to-solve bugs, cross-domain debugging, and making broken systems stable. 

> **If it crashes and nobody knows why, Iâ€™ll find out.**

âš¡ Quick info: 
 - I am most proficient in C, C++, Zig, Odin, Go, and Python.
 - I also have limited experience with C#, F#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Groovy, Julia, Ruby, Lua, Gleam, Haskell, OCaml, Rust, and PHP.
   - (I did say I like language design)
 - My favorite game engines are Unreal (for 3D) and Godot (for 2D).
