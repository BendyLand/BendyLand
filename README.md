ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben! (a.k.a. @BendyLand)
 - I'm a systems programmer who enjoys working with internal tooling, language design, and low-level development.
 - I build software that simplifies complex workflows and enhances developer productivity.
 - I also think game development is pretty neat.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on a variety of projects to deepen my understanding of software design and low-level programming.
 - I consider myself most proficient in C++, Rust, Go, and Python.
 - Besides those, I have experimented with C#, F#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Groovy, Julia, Ruby, Lua, Gleam, Haskell, OCaml, C, Odin, Zig, and PHP.
   - Of those ones, I would **love** to have more excuses to try Elixir, Scala, Swift, Julia, Odin, and Zig more in-depth. 
   - (I did say I like language design.)
 - My favorite game engines are Unreal (for 3D) and Godot (for 2D).
