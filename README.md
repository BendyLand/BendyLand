ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben! (a.k.a. @BendyLand)

ðŸŒ± I enjoy systems programming, particularly involving internal tooling, language design, and other low-level development. I often write software that simplifies complex workflows and enhances developer productivity. I also think game development is pretty neat.
 - I am most proficient in C++, Rust, Go, and Python.
 - Besides those, I have some experience with C#, F#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Groovy, Julia, Ruby, Lua, Gleam, Haskell, OCaml, C, Odin, Zig, and PHP.
  - (I did say I like language design)
 - My favorite game engines are Unreal (for 3D) and Godot (for 2D).
