ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BendyLand or Ben

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in software systems programming, specifically surrounding internal tooling and/or language design.
 - I also think game development is pretty neat. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming on my own. (I may not have a CS degree, but luckily I do have one in education.) 
 - Right now, my favorite langauges to use are Rust, Go, C, C++, F#, Lua, and Python.
 - Besides those, I have tried (at least a little) C#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Groovy, Julia, Ruby, Gleam, OCaml, Odin, Zig, and PHP.
   - Of those ones, I would **love** to have more excuses to try Elixir, Scala, Swift, Julia, Odin, and Zig more in-depth. I just haven't gotten around to using them for real yet, but I think they're all very cool-looking languages. 
   - (I did say I like language design.)
 - My favorite game engines are Unreal (for 3D) and Godot (for 2D).
