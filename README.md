ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BendyLand or Ben

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in software systems programming, specifically surrounding internal tooling and/or language design.
 - I also think game development is pretty neat. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of programming and general computer science on my own. (I may not have a CS degree, but luckily I do have one in education.) 
 - I have a habit of trying out very simple programs in several languages before moving onto something harder. 
 - Right now, my favorite langauges to use are Rust, Scala, Go, C, C++, F#, Lua, Julia, and Python.
 - Overall, I have tried (at least a little) of the above languages plus C#, Elixir, JS, TS, Clojure, Kotlin, Groovy, Ruby, Swift, Gleam, Odin, Zig, and PHP.
   - If a language is not currently one of my favorites, that does not mean that it hasn't been one in the past, nor that it won't ever be one (again) in the future.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, they/them, it/that, hey you... (I'm not very picky; call me whatever's easiest.)

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a twisty puzzles enthusiast. My "morning crossword" equivalent is: 
 - 2x2 > 3x3 > 4x4 > 5x5 Rubik's cubes, followed by 
 - Pyraminx > Skewb > Megaminx > Curvy Copter, and finally
 - Square-1 > Puppet Cube v2 > Ghost Cube > Tony Fisher's Golden Cube.
   - This list goes roughly in order of how much trouble the puzzle gives *me*, isolated by each row. 
     - This means it is not necessarily in order from strictly easiest to strictly hardest.
   - The whole thing takes me around an hour to solve; sometimes a bit shorter if I get lucky, and sometimes a bit longer if I get weird jumbling cases in the later puzzles.
   - Somehow, this is fun to me.
